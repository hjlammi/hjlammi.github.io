            <h2>Studies</h2>
            <p>I'm <span class="age"></span> years old, and I'm now pursuing a career that will hopefully be something that I will do the rest of my life.
              I have studied some other subjects in the past. If I had know what programming
              was when first applying for university studies years and years ago, I wouldn't have needed to try so hard to find my path all these years.
              But better late than never to find out how fun computer science can be, eh!</p>

                    Weather data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap's API (https://openweathermap.org/api).
                    The app is still a work in progress as I intend to include a sliding menu with options to show the weather
                    for the next 5 days and an option to search for the weather in other locations.

                    With the application you can report duck sightings and view all the reported duck sightings. In the implementation
                    I utilize React components provided by <a href="www.material-ui.com" target="_blank">Material-UI</a>.

              <li>Test-Driven Development and unit-testing (mainly in Java and Python): I like the idea of decomposing a programming task or problem
                into smaller subproblems which can be tested separately and solved independently of the main problem.
                Furthermore, unit-testing helps to notice if newly implemented code breaks any of the previously written tests.
                It is one of the best feelings when all tests pass.

          <h2>Thoughts and plans</h2>
          <p>When trying to learn coding concepts, I think it is important to try to understand what you are doing instead of
            simply copying stuff from Stack Overflow. In addition to the <i>how</i> something is done, I'm also curious about <i>why</i> something is done the way it is done.</p>
          <p>At this level of competence I think my strengths are in Front-End Development since that is what I have practised the most.
            Usability of an app and responsive design are naturally essential factors in front-end development. I'm also interested in the visual aspect of a product.
            Accessibility is something that I would like to learn more about.</p>
          <p>Even though I'm still in the beginning of my career I'm always interested in learning more and developing my skills further.
            In the spring term I will take courses in, for example, database programming, web programming and Haskell,
            after which I'm convinced I will know enough to be able to move on to perform well and learn more in real-life working environment.
            It is not a problem for me to have to learn new skills (i've basically done it my whole life!) which is essential in this line of work.</p>
          <p>In near future I want to keep learning more about React. For example, component lifecycles are still a bit of a mystery to me: when to use what and why.
            Redux library would be nice to take into use as well. I've also started learning Clojure but due to more urgent stuff to learn, the project is on hold for now.
            I'd also like to build a chatbot and my own version of a Twitter-kind-of-a messaging service with bots tweeting content. There are so many cool things to learn and so little time!</p>
