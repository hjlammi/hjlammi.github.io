          <p>I'm beginning my 4th year at University of Tampere studying for a Master's degree in Computer Sciences. It is         hopefully my last year as a student as I will start working on my thesis in this fall. The subject of the thesis will be Test-Driven Development which is a something I feel quite passionate about.<br>
          I'm also working as a (mainly backend) developer in a company called <a href="https://www.exove.com/fi/" target="_blank">Exove.</a>

            <h2>Studies</h2>
            <p>I'm <span class="age"></span> years old, and I'm now finally pursuing a career that will be something that I will do the rest of my life. I have studied some other subjects in the past but if I had know what programming was when first applying for university studies years and years ago, I wouldn't have needed to try so hard to find my path all these years. But better late than never to find out how much fun coding can be, eh!</p>

          <h2>Technologies</h2>

          <p>At work I am part of a team working on a customer's video streaming platform. One application I developed for it during my trainee period in the summer 2018 is an integration component between the backend system and YouTube: it is responsible for uploading a video file to YouTube, updating its metadata and finally deleting the video from YouTube. The application was a real learning experience and a fun one as I got to learn some cool new things such as AWS and Terraform.</p>

          <p>AWS and Terraform have actually become quite familiar to me during my working career as we are in the process of moving our customer's backend system to the cloud.</p>

          <p>Another project I have been working on together with one of our current trainees is a dashboard or an info screen for showing different kind of data. In that project I've worked as a mentor for the trainee as well as worked on mainly the backend implemented with NodeJS. The frontend part of the app is made with ReactJS.</p>

          <p>Below I've listed some other projects, school-related or hobby ones, that I've worked on since the beginning of my studies. All of them can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/hjlammi" target="_blank">Github page.</a></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Javascript</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://turo.hjlm.dev/#/login"></a>A Twitter-style application for writing short messages for logged in users. It was the coursework for Secure Programming course in the spring 2019. The application is deployed to AWS using Codepipeline and it was implemented using NodeJS, Serverless, Terraform, ReactJS and <a href="https://redux-saga.js.org/">Redux Saga</a>. Test-Driven Development was used in the process: integration testing was done using <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank">Cypress.io</a> and Mocha was used for backend testing.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://people.uta.fi/~hl424546/weatherapp/" target="_blank">Weather application</a>
                    shows the current weather at the user's geolocation (if the geolocation is available, otherwise an error message is shown).
                    Weather data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap's API (https://openweathermap.org/api).
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://people.uta.fi/~hl424546/duckapp/" target="_blank">DuckApp</a>
                    is a single-page web application I made for Vincit's <a href="http://koodarijahti.fi/" target="_blank">koodarijahti</a> for summer 2018.
                    With the application you can report duck sightings and view all the reported duck sightings. In the implementation
                    I utilize components provided by <a href="www.material-ui.com" target="_blank">Material-UI</a>.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li>Haskell</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The coursework for Advanced Functional Programming course in the spring 2019. The application is a sort of an text-processing AI from which you can ask simple questions to which it tries to give a logical answer based on the text it was given. It was a really interesting project to work on and I'd love to study funtional programming more in the future! <a href="https://github.com/hjlammi/haskell-coursework">Github page for the coursework.</a> </li>

                    asks the user for line width and a piece of text and wraps the text into the lines according to the line width.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/hjlammi/ASCIIArt" target="_blank">ASCIIArt</a>
                    gets the name of an ASCII graph text file as a command-line argument and reads its contents into a 2D array.
                    The program allows the user to perform different kinds of commands on the graph, e.g. the graph can be printed on the screen or it can be filtered.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/hjlammi/SimpleOOPEShell" target="_blank">SimpleOOPEShell</a>
                    simulates a textual user interface that takes commands from the user and processes files and folders accordingly. </li>

                    uses THREE.js to render spinning 3D Christmas ball ornaments and falling snow.
